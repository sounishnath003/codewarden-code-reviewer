Thought: Okay, I have the diff. Now I need to analyze it and provide feedback. I'll go through each file and identify potential issues.

**File: CommitsReview.md**

*   Issue: The entire file has been removed.
*   Recommendation: Consider if this file is still needed. If it is, restore it or regenerate it. If not, confirm its removal is intentional.

**File: README.md**

*   Issue: Added project structure to the README.
*   Recommendation: Ensure the project structure is up-to-date and accurate. Consider using a tool to automatically generate this structure if the project grows.

**File: codewarden/ai/agents.py**

*   Issue: Line 9: Added `GitHubCommitCommentTool`.
*   Recommendation: Ensure this tool is properly configured and used in the correct context.
*   Issue: Line 35: Added `tools=self.tools` and `llm=conf.llm` to `WorkspaceContextAgent`.
*   Recommendation: Verify that the `tools` and `llm` are necessary for this agent and that they are being used correctly.
*   Issue: Line 85-88: Added `GitHubCommitCommentTool` to `GithubCommentAgent`.
*   Recommendation: Ensure that the `GithubCommentAgent` is now able to comment on both PRs and commits, and that the logic for choosing the correct tool is implemented.

**File: main.py**

*   Issue: Line 23: Changed import from `codewarden.ai.tasks import CodeReviewTask` to `codewarden.ai import tasks`.
*   Recommendation: Verify that all necessary tasks are still accessible after this change.
*   Issue: Line 107-118: Modified the `Crew` initialization to include `context_agent`, `code_review_agent`, and commented out `test_agent` and `comment_agent`. Also updated the tasks accordingly.
*   Recommendation: Ensure that the workflow is still functioning as expected with the updated agent and task
